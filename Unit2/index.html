<h2>Which two sites are you most inspired by:</h2>

The two websites I am inspired by are FourSeasons.com and Homes.com

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<h3>
<a href="Fourseasons.com">Four Seasons</a>
</h3>
I believe Four Seasons exhibits effective use of space because they strategically managed to get tons of information on the homepage without it feeling overwhelming. The main image changes every few seconds, but the reservation information (which overlaps the main image) stays - which is ultimatley the end goal here. They are luring you in with the oversized beautiful images of their resorts, and making it easy to reserve with just a few clicks. I think everything is nicely balanced and clearly defined within their site.

<h3>
<a href="Homes.com">Homes.com</a>
</h3>



<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
Similar - I think they both use color effectively. Neither wesbite is boring, all wording is legible. There is hierarchy in terms of what is important and I think the purpose of the website is defined from the start. Also, both websites use the center of the page to grab your attention. 
<br>
Different - Homes.com has a stable background photo and Four Seasons has an everchanging background photo - of there many different resorts.


<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<img src="homes.jpg" alt="Homes" height="420" width="420">
</li>

<p> I think this uses good use of space and hierarchy because the main photo is a picture of a beautful house/ home. And then each circle at the bottom is a quick link to help you get started in your home search. It's a simple design that gets the point across and the user is able to effectively get from point A to B. And since the photo is large, they are able to visualize themselves in the house (which I think it important when searching for a home - to be able to see yourself there)
</p>

<li>
<img src="resorts.jpg" alt="Resorts" height="420" width='420'
</li>
</ul>
<p> This one I believe uses good use of space because it has the name/ title drawing your attention to the center and then each smaller "square" around the title is a different featured resort.
